# !!! THESE ARE NOT EXAMPLES !!!

This is experimental code that the Silk.NET team has put together to test an idea or prove a Silk.NET library. As such, a lot of the projects here look like examples but they in fact are not - they will often demonstrate terrible programming practices and other corner-cutting in the name of getting the experiment working, and should not be used as a reference in development of your own applications.

# Welcome to the Silk.NET lab!

This is where we'll put applications that test Silk.NET, as well as other experimental projects.

You don't really need to worry about what goes on in this folder, but there might be some notices below.

## Notices
Sike there are no notices!

For now at least.
